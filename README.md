# Machine-Learning-Image-Recoginition-Final-Project
This was the final draft of my senior research project. 

For this project my team and i went out and took pictures of the sky for our data set. We tried to get as many cloudy and sunny skies as possible.

Afterwards our objective was to use Keras and Tensorflow to develop a script that would run through our practice dataset and determine if the test data was sunny or cloudy.
